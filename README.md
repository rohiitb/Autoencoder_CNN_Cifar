# Autoencoder_CNN_Cifar

This project was done as a part of the course CIS520 : Machine Learning. In this project, we have implemented two neural networks. We have implemented an Autoencoder network to denoise the images and regenerate them without the noise. We have also trained a CNN on the CIFAR dataset to predict classes of the input objects.
